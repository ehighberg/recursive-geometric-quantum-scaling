Module: topological_invariants.py
This module provides functions to compute topological invariants such as Chern numbers, 
winding numbers, and ℤ₂ indices for quantum systems. It implements standard mathematical
definitions for these invariants that can be applied to systems with any scaling factor.

Enhanced with:
- Multiple phase unwrapping algorithms for stability
- Consensus-based winding number calculation
- Wilson loop approach for Berry phase calculation
- Confidence metrics for all calculated invariants
- Adaptive thresholds for detecting topological features
