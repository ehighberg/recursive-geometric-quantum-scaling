## Working Around Known Issues

Based on the issues identified in the codebase, here are strategies to collect valid data despite implementation problems:

### 1. Redundant Scaling Factor Application

**Issue**: Scaling factors are applied multiple times in different components.

**Workaround**:
- Use consistent scaling factors within a given experiment
- Compare relative differences between scaling factors rather than absolute values
- Verify results by running the same experiment twice to check for consistency

### 2. Phi-Specific Modifications

**Issue**: Some metrics are artificially modified based on proximity to φ.

**Workaround**:
- Focus on raw state evolution data, which is less affected by these issues
- Compare multiple metrics to corroborate findings
- Validate results across different analysis tabs
- Look for patterns that appear consistently across multiple metrics

### 3. Artificial Result Generation

**Issue**: Some visualizations may show artificial patterns.

**Workaround**:
- Focus on direct quantum metrics rather than derived fractal properties
- Validate patterns by checking if they consistently appear across multiple runs
- Use the "Raw Data" tab to examine underlying numerical data
- Cross-validate observations between different visualization methods

### 4. Output Quality Issues

**Issue**: Nearly all outputs have "high" severity issues.

**Workaround**:
- Run controlled comparisons where you change only one parameter at a time
- Look for relative differences rather than absolute values
- Use statistical methods to determine if differences are significant
- Document all parameter settings precisely for reproducibility

## Data Organization for Your Paper

When organizing data for your paper, follow this structure:

### 1. Baseline Characterization
- Standard quantum evolution without scaling
- Basic metrics and visualizations
- Establish a foundation for comparison

### 2. Comparative Scaling Analysis
- Systematic comparison across scaling factors
- Statistical analysis of differences
- Highlight any unique properties of φ

### 3. Specific Phi-Related Phenomena
- Focus on effects that are strongest or most unique near φ
- Provide multiple lines of evidence for each phenomenon
- Include control experiments with non-phi values

### 4. Theoretical Connections
- Link empirical observations to theoretical predictions
- Connect to established quantum physics concepts
- Propose mechanisms for observed phi-specific effects

## Final Recommendations

1. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed notes of all parameter settings and observations
2. **Use Version Control**: Note the exact version of RGQS used for each experiment
3. **Statistical Validation**: Run multiple trials for key experiments
4. **Critical Analysis**: Distinguish genuine physical effects from implementation artifacts
5. **Reproducibility**: Ensure all reported results can be reproduced with documented settings
