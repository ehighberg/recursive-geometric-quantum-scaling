    Abstract base class for braid generators.
    
    In the Fibonacci anyon model, the fusion rule τ × τ = 1 + τ leads to a 
    two-dimensional Hilbert space for the fusion channels. Braiding operations 
    are represented by unitary matrices constructed from the F-matrix (which 
    recouples fusion channels) and the R-matrices (which assign braiding phases).

        dim (int): Dimensionality of the Hilbert space (typically 2 for Fibonacci anyons).
