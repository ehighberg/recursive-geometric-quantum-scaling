# RGQS Evolution Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address the Tier 1 critical framework issues in the RGQS (Recursive Geometric Quantum Scaling) project.

## 1. Standardized Eigenvalue Computation

- Created a dedicated `compute_eigenvalues` function in `simulations/quantum_utils.py` that properly handles different Hamiltonian object types.
- Updated `analyses/fractal_analysis.py` to use this standardized function.
- Ensures consistent eigenvalue computation across the entire codebase.

## 2. Centralized Unitary Scaling Implementation

- Made `simulations/scaled_unitary.py` the canonical source for unitary scaling functions.
- Removed the TODO comment that suggested possibly removing these functions.
- Clarified in the module docstring that scaling factors are applied EXACTLY ONCE.

## 3. Standardized Evolution Interface

- Created a unified `evolve_quantum_state` function in `simulations/quantum_utils.py` that serves as the central evolution function.
- Added proper documentation, including explicit warnings about applying scaling factors exactly once.
- Created backwards-compatible function aliases for `run_quantum_evolution` and `evolve_state_fixed`.
- Implemented specialized internal functions `_evolve_standard` and `_evolve_phi_recursive` with consistent interfaces.

## 4. Refactored Evolution Functions 

- Updated `run_state_evolution` to use the new standardized `evolve_quantum_state` function.
- Updated `run_phi_recursive_evolution` to use the same standardized function, ensuring consistency.
- Added clear documentation in both functions explicitly stating that scaling factors are applied EXACTLY ONCE.
- Fixed Hamiltonian functions to apply scaling correctly.

## 5. Remaining Changes Needed

While we've fixed the most critical issues, some Tier 2 problems should be addressed in future updates:

1. Review and fix `run_phi_scaled_twoqubit_circuit` to ensure it doesn't apply scaling factors twice.
2. Fix energy spectrum computations in `generate_paper_graphs.py`.
3. Clean up duplicate code in various evolution implementations.
4. Establish standard interfaces for noise models across all evolution functions.

## Benefits

These changes ensure:

1. **Consistent Scaling**: All functions now apply scaling factors exactly once, eliminating a major source of errors.
2. **Standardized Interface**: A uniform API simplifies code maintenance and enhances reliability.
3. **Improved Eigenvalue Handling**: Eigenvalues are now calculated correctly regardless of object type.
4. **Better Documentation**: Clear warnings and notes about proper scaling usage.

This represents the completion of the Tier 1 critical framework fixes identified in our analysis.
