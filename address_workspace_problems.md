# Plan to Address Workspace Problems

## Introduction
This plan outlines the steps to resolve the identified issues in the project, prioritizing tasks to address cascading problems effectively. Special attention is given to items labeled as TODOs to ensure critical functionalities are implemented.

## Priority 1: Fix Critical Errors
### 1. Undefined Variable in `app/analyze_results.py`
- **Issue**:
  - **Line 61**: Undefined variable `mode` ([Pylint Error](#))
  - **Line 107**: Undefined variable `mode` ([Pylint Error](#))
  - **Line 61**: "mode" is not defined ([Pylance Warning](#))
  - **Line 107**: "mode" is not defined ([Pylance Warning](#))
- **Action**:
  - Define the `mode` variable appropriately in both instances to eliminate the undefined variable errors.
  - Review the usage of `mode` to ensure it aligns with the intended functionality.
  - If `mode` is redundant, consider removing it from the codebase.

### 2. Indentation Error in `analyses/visualization/metric_plots.py`
- **Issue**:
  - **Line 352**: Parsing failed: 'expected an indented block after function definition on line 350 ([Pylint Error](#))
  - **Line 352**: Expected indented block ([Pylance Error](#))
- **Action**:
  - Add the missing indented block after the function definition on line 350 to resolve the parsing error.
  - Ensure consistent indentation throughout the file to prevent similar issues.

## Priority 2: Clean Up Unused Imports and Arguments
### 1. `app/analyze_results.py`
- **Issues**:
  - **Line 293**: Unused argument `mode` ([Pylint Warning](#))
- **Action**:
  - Remove the unused `mode` argument from the function signature if it is not required.
  - If `mode` is necessary for future development, consider implementing its usage to eliminate the warning.

### 2. `analyses/visualization/metric_plots.py`
- **Issues**:
  - **Line 9**: Unused `Any` imported from the `typing` module ([Pylint Warning](#))
- **Action**:
 - **Action**: ✓ FIXED
  - Removed the unused `Any` import from the `typing` module.

## Priority 3: Implement TODO Items
### 1. Configure Braiding Circuit Using Parameters in `app.py`
- **Issue**:
  - **Line 142**: TODO: use params to configure braiding circuit.
- **Action**:
  - Modify the braiding circuit configuration in `app.py` to accept and utilize parameters.
  - Ensure that the circuit configuration is dynamic and can be adjusted based on provided parameters.

### 2. Implement Data Export Functionality in `app.py`
- **Issue**:
  - **Line 268**: TODO: Implement data export functionality.
- **Action**:
  - Develop functions in `app.py` to export data in the required formats.
  - Integrate the export functionality with existing data processing workflows to ensure seamless operation.

### 3. Implement Metrics Export in `app.py`
- **Issue**:
  - **Line 273**: TODO: Implement metrics export.
- **Action**:
  - Create mechanisms in `app.py` to export metrics data accurately.
  - Ensure that the exported metrics are in the desired format and integrated with the application's data handling processes.

## Priority 4: Ensure Code Quality and Maintainability
- **Action**:
  - Run linting tools to identify and fix any additional warnings or errors.
  - Implement automated tests to verify that fixes do not introduce new issues.
  - Document all changes and update relevant documentation to reflect the modifications.

## Conclusion
By following this prioritized plan, we aim to resolve critical errors that hinder functionality, address function parameter mismatches and undefined variables that could lead to further issues, clean up the codebase for better maintainability, and implement pending features essential for the project's success. Addressing these issues systematically will ensure a robust and efficient codebase.

Progress Update:
- ✓ Fixed Priority 1 issues (Critical Errors)
- ✓ Cleaned up Priority 2 issues
- □ Implemented Priority 3 TODO items
- □ Addressed Priority 4 code quality improvements
